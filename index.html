	  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

	<div class="span6">
	  <dl>
	    <dt><p>What is congestion control?</p></dt>

	    <dd><p>On the Internet, most of the intelligence lies in
the endpoint computers, not inside the network. One of the
endpoints' responsibilities is to fairly share the network's limited
resources among themselves.</p>

<p>For example, in a house with a 10 Mbps connection to
the Internet, with two users trying to upload a video to YouTube at
the same time, it's usually the users' computers that decide how the 10 Mbps
will be split. Does one get 9 Mbps and the other 1 Mbps?
Do they split the capacity evenly? Does the one with the shorter video
get to go first? By sending too aggressively, do these uploads force real-time
conversations
(e.g. a Skype call) to <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net">suffer large delays</a>?</p>

<p>These questions are the province
  of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_avoidance_algorithm">TCP
  congestion control</a>: an algorithm contained in every computer
  on the Internet, governing how it shares
  the network with other computers. TCP is arguably the most
  widely-used computer program in the world. It runs
  the World Wide Web and services like Netflix and YouTube.</p></dd>

	    <dt><p>What makes Remy different?</p></dt>

<dd><p>Up to this point, human designers have created TCP's
 congestion-control algorithms by hand. There have
 been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_avoidance_algorithm">many
 such schemes</a> over the last 25 years: TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno,
 Vegas, FAST, BIC, Cubic (Linux's current default), Compound
 (Windows's current default), etc. As the Internet has matured and
 evolved, crossing oceans and including wireless networks and ultrafast
 datacenters, so too have protocol designers added bells and
 whistles to our congestion-control algorithms.</p>

<p>But while it is easy to lay out the rules that govern a single
  endpoint running TCP Cubic, the <strong>emergent behavior</strong> of a flock of
  machines running Cubic is complicated and
  difficult to characterize. It can even be
  unstable. Congestion-control schemes each embody
  implicit assumptions and preconceptions about the network, but we don't quite
  know what they are. And
  the <a href="http://www.wischik.com/damon/Work/Talks/ipteleology.pdf">teleology
  of TCP</a> &mdash; the end goal that these algorithms
  try to achieve
  &mdash; is unknown in general, when connections start and stop over time.</p>

<p>We propose to flip this around. With Remy, human protocol designers
  specify explicitly their prior knowledge and assumptions about the
  network and a goal to strive for. Remy then creates an algorithm to
  run at the endpoints &mdash; possibly a complex one, but with simple
  emergent behavior: achieving the goal as best as possible on
  networks described by the stated assumptions.</p></dd>

	    <dt><p>How does this help the Internet?</p></dt>

	    <dt><p>How well do Remy's computer-generated algorithms work?</p></dt>

<dd><p>We tested Remy's computer-generated algorithms both on networks
    within the range for which they were designed (networks
    consistent with the prior assumptions)
    and on networks outside that range.</p>

<p>In the former case, the best computer-designed algorithms
  outperformed all our human-designed schemes to date &mdash; not only
  other end-to-end schemes, but also algorithms that depend
  on code running inside the network, such as <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2002/papers/xcp.html">XCP</a> and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoDel">sfqCoDel</a>.</p>

<p>For example, with eight senders sharing a 15 Mbps link, a
  Remy-generated algorithm achieved more than <b>twice</b> the median
  throughput, with <b>less than half</b> the queueing delay, of Compound TCP
  and TCP NewReno. It achieved <b>70% more throughput</b> than TCP Cubic and
  more than a <b>threefold</b> reduction in queueing delay.</p>

<p>Performance varied with how specific the prior knowledge was. In
  general, the more specific the prior knowledge the better, as long
  as it is correct. But on networks that didn't meet the given assumptions,
  performance of Remy's algorithms deteriorated the further the
  network was from what Remy had been told to expect. A full
  discussion of these results is available
  in <a href="TCPexMachina.pdf">the research paper.</a></p></dd>

<dt><p>How do I interpret the performance plots?</p></dt>

<dd><p>We summarize the behavior of congestion-control schemes on
    a throughput-delay plot. For a given network and traffic
    model, we run many simulations of each scheme. We calculate the
    median throughput and queueing delay in each run,
    as well as the 1-&sigma; ellipses showing the variability
    (unfairness) of outcome per sender.</p>

  <p class="text-center"><img width="360" src="legend.svg"></p>

  <p>On the plot, throughput is shown on the y-axis, and better
    throughputs are found as the graph gets higher. Delay is shown on
    the <b>flipped x-axis</b>: better delays are found as the graph
    moves to the right. The best schemes are in the upper-right-hand
    corner. The efficient frontier &mdash; the best available
    tradeoffs between throughput and delay &mdash; is shown in
    blue:</p>

				      throughput-delay plot (Fig. 7
				      of paper)</b></p></div>

<p>Results of several more simulations are available in <a href="TCPexMachina.pdf">the
    research paper</a>.</p></dd>

<dt><p>How does Remy work?</p></dt>

<dt><p>Why do the computer-generated algorithms get these results?</p></dt>

<dt><p>How is it possible that end-to-end algorithms can outperform in-network schemes like XCP and sfqCoDel?</p></dt>

<dt><p>Isn't TCP basically good enough?</p></dt>

<dt><p>Should a Remy-designed algorithm replace TCP?</p></dt>

<dt><p>Are you overfitting?</p></dt>
